#### Room Page

Below is an example of the room page in `forbid-hand` & `Two-Players` mode. The White needs to make her own judgement on whether the Black is forbidden.

If it's `normal` mode, when the global steps turns to 3 (2 black 1 white), the White needs to choose whether to switch identities.

If it's `Single-Player` mode, ths White is set as the Robot we developed, and the rule is the most primary here, _i.e._ no switch & no forbidden.
